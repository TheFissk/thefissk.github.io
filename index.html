          <b>Hello there!</b><br />
          My name is Timothy Fiss and I am a Junior Computer Developer from
          Regina, Saskatchewan. I have a passion for technology and a deep
          interest in the field of computer science. I am constantly seeking
          opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills in the ever-evolving
          world of software development.<br />

          With a strong foundation in programming languages such as Python,
          Javascript, and C++, I am confident in my ability to develop
          high-quality software applications. I am also familiar with various
          technologies and tools including Agile methodologies, Git, and SQL.<br />

          In a previous role I played a key role in enabling cross-team
          communication and providing technical support. I am a quick learner
          and always willing to go the extra mile to ensure projects are
          completed to the best of my ability.<br />

          Aside from my technical skills, I am a team player and value strong
          communication and collaboration in the workplace. I am always looking
          for ways to contribute to the success of a project and actively seek
          out feedback to continuously improve my performance.<br />

          I am excited about the opportunity to grow my career in the tech
          industry and take on new challenges. I am open to new learning
          opportunities and am eager to continue to expand my skill set. <br />

        <p class="Block-Text">
          In 2017 I read a
          <a
            href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0003347212002102"
            >paper</a
          >
          on using the optical flow algorithm to measure the behaviour of
          poultry, correlating it to several welfare measures in poultry.
          optical flow is a method commonly used in computer vision to measure
          the movement of pixels in a video stream. The author of the paper used
          specialized equipment to collect the video of the poultry, and focused
          on real-time analysis of the birds. This made it ill suited for the
          research environment at the University of Saskatchewan where I was
          studying at the time. At the U of S we already had infrastructure
          installed to allow for the collection of video which was incompatible
          with her system. I had a desire to replicate her work in a way that
          would accept any standard video input, allowing for post-hoc
          evaluation of the metric. At that time, I had no formal computer
          science experience or education, so this project exceeded my
          capabilities. I was successful in creating a function that could take
          a video input and perform the analysis on it, but it was not efficient
          or performance-optimized.
          <br />In 2020 I revisited the project to demonstrate to my colleagues
          at Chicken Farmers of Ontario how it worked and discuss its
          applications in the poultry industry. At that time I modified it to
          create a simple live demonstration. <br /><br />

        <h2 class="Block-Title">Fraction Estimation</h2>
        <p class="Block-Text">
          In Early 2021 a friend of mine wanted to know the fractional grade
          they got when they recieved a grade a 76.83% (They only had a rough
          idea of how much the project was worth). This seemed like a problem
          that a computer would be well suited to solving.<br />
          The first solution I explored was using continued fractions to get
          closer and closer to estimating the desired decimal. This was fast,
          but its output was sparse, in this case missing 7/9 which was the
          simplified version of the mark he recieved: 35/49. <br />
          The next solution I explored used the Farey Sequence to produce the
          results. I found an algorithm that would produce the next fraction
          between two fractions in the sequence. So the fractions 1/3 and 1/2
          are next to each other when the denominators are less than 4. The
          algorithm with these inputs would produce 2/5 as its the next fraction
          between the two. My program used these fractions to output
          increasingly accurate (fully reduced) fractions until the exact
          representation was determined. While not as efficient as continued
          fractions, this algorithm would produce a complete list of fractional
          esimations starting from the lowest denominator, going to the largest.
          It was limited by float accuracy, but it only accepted values between
          0 and 1 where floats are their most accurate to limit this inaccuracy.
          <br />
          This programs performance is held back by my homemade greatest common
          divisor algorithm. Faster execution could likely be achieved if
          performance was the highest priority. <br /><br />

        <p class="Block-Text">
          Done for a class on animations, this particular program was
          laser-focused on producing as many particles using the webgl framework
          as possible. It achieves this by performing as much of the computation
          on the graphics card as possible. On my 2080Ti I experienced
          significant performance bottlenecks at around 80,000 active particles.
          <br />
          While this program is already quite effienct, there is still
          significant room for improvement. My understanding of linear algebra
          as it applies to graphics was still primitive and there are several
          optimizations available. I could also shift some of the workload back
          to the js to help balance the program better as the js currently
          represents only a small portion of the total frame time. There is also
          an opportunity to create a fixed object buffer that would have reduced
          the amount of memory reallocation that the js had to perform each
          from, reducing the likelyhood of a long frame due to garbage
          collection. <br /><br />
